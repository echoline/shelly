This is meant for Ubuntu 9.10

First put one.py where you want it and add these lines to your .bashrc or /etc/bash.bashrc:

function command_not_found_handle {
	/path/to/one.py $*
	return 127
}

Next, run the Shelly.pl script to activate Shelly.  You may want to activate Shelly every time you boot by putting something like this in /etc/rc.local:

perl /path/to/Shelly.pl > /tmp/shelly.log &

Alternatively, you can just run `make install' as yourself to edit just your .bashrc and as root to edit root's .bashrc and /etc/rc.local

Hope somebody enjoys this :)
