Requires bash, perl, and the perl rivescript module

First put 'one' where you want it and add these lines to your .bashrc or /etc/bash.bashrc:

function command_not_found_handle {
	/path/to/one "$*"
	return 127
}

Next, run the Shelly.pl script to activate Shelly.  You may want to activate Shelly every time you boot by putting something like this in /etc/rc.local:

perl /path/to/Shelly.pl > /tmp/shelly.log &

Then you can talk to your shell

Hope somebody enjoys this :)
